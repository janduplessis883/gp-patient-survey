So you could only call it a single label, with no backing musicians. So what do you do, do you get the backing from anybody? When I was younger I was always at home singing songs, but now I'm at home performing. Even I never did anything that was as good as that. Then I heard about music, and the world started to turn around, I love it and I'm glad people like it.\n",
