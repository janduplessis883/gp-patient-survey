2024-02-22 15:55:41,Earls Court Surgery,Fairly easy,Very dissatisfied,Very poor,Very poor,Very poor,"It’s very frustrating the process of booking any appointments, the waiting time to see a doctor is for a phone call with the doctors 1week while for a in person appointment is 2 weeks. Receptionists take liberty to decide if you are urgent or not and booking the appointments accordingly saying the doctors are busy, then when you go in person there isn’t anyone in the clinic and doctors are free. The doctors take everything lightly and they don’t even check your symptoms, refuse to make referrals to the NHS and suggest to go privately. Sometimes i wait 2-3months before seeing my GP as I know the answer will always be “you have nothing so don’t worry” by only looking my face.

The speed with which Dr [PERSON] effected my transfer made it posdible for me be urgently seen very quickly by a top cancer consultant and rapidly undergo  blood tests,MRI and PET, scans quickly followed up with intense chemotherapy, which enabled me to then go onto chemoradiotherapy and I am now on immunology trials.

Follow-up with repeat prescriptions &c are also excellent.  There have been a few occasions in the past when individuals on the reception desk have seemed brusque or impatient though I can't imagine this was intentional, and more recently they have been much more welcoming and helpful.  Perhaps an NHS-wide issue is inter-site/department communication between specialist hospital provision and surgery monitoring, resulting in duplication of procedures such as blood pressure and other function tests.  For example, I have a wide spectrum of tests at Chelsea & Westminster twice a year as part of my ongoing HIV management, but I suspect these are not passed to you (despite my permission to do so). If they were they could save surgery time collecting the data again .

Most days if you don’t wait 50 minutes to get through at 8am you get told there’s no Drs on due to illness usually. Only being able to call at 8am is unfair. I have a very stressful and busy job and 8am is when I need to commute. I either lose my job or suffer health problems as you dare not ring at any other time or reception will snap at you and tell you the next non emergency appointment is in 2026. If you do get an appointment it’s on the phone, then the Dr gets you to come in anyway… It’s double the time spent on an issue cos the reception staff on the phone flat out refuse to let you bypass the pointless phone calls. Huge changes are needed at this surgery, it’s an utter disgrace! The Drs are very good if you ever get to see one. The reception staff are extremely obstructive and devoid of common sense. They live and die by what the computer tells them. I understand that the Tories have defunded the NHS massively, but the reception staff could at least try a little to help more. I’m sick to the teeth of paying an outrageous amount in tax that pays your staffs wages to be treated like crap and never get a Drs appointment. I have gone private multiple times over the last few years cos of how bad this survey is. Shame on you all.

I had a horrible experience few years ago with a nurse who tried to introduce a coil and she nearly tortured me to make also very humiliating comments . The coil was easily introduce by a private gynaecologist. I referred the matter to doctor hussein . I dismissed me without [PERSON] answering . I went to the practise again recently after a very painful renal colic and a recurrent issue with my shoulder . The GP who visited me was kind but superficial . After the colic I should be referred to stone clinic ( as I have still one ) and I should repeat the blood test . There was also an anomaly in the other kidney . She dismissed me with nothing . She just suggested to self refer to physio clinic for my shoulder but I am doing things privately. Only way to survive .

I have been monitored regularly for blood pressure and cholesterol changes and have been efficiently issued with the appropriate prescriptions and vaccinations. Had my GP not seen the slight rise in my PSA levels, I would not have had the opportunity to receive excellent prostrate cancer treatment and after-care from Royal Marsden in their Rapid Diagnostic Centre. Happily, over the last two years I have had very positive outcomes from the mandatory blood tests and now on 6-monthly checks instead of three monthly. At 78, I remain in full time professional practice and have not had to take a single day off on account of my health.

(1) It's been a pain trying to schedule vaccinations for my baby daughter - if we try to arrange ahead of time, when prompted by the SMS messages received, then reception staff tell us that the rota isn't yet available and that they'll call us back once it is, but then they don't call back and when we then call to arrange a time, we find that the times are impossible ones (and that sometimes you can spend almost an hour on hold as the second in the queue). 
(2) I was asked to come in for a blood pressure test, but wasn't seen for an hour despite speaking to reception staff several times, only to finally be told I could use the machine at the back of the reception (which was news to me!). I still then got a call a few hours later telling me I hadn't shown up!

If I were holding a fevered baby and had a crying two year old clinging to my legs, I would be angry at being told to treat you with courtesy and to use your website.  In a worried state, I wouldn’t be an able to navigate your website or any other!
My only appointment  in a long time was in January this year for bronchitis.   I was seen by a doctor I had never heard of who prescribed Amoxicillin.  After seven days on this, I was in a worse state and several friends told me it always was  a useless antibiotic.   A private doctor then put me on Zithromax for five days which finally had an effect.  I conclude that Amoxicillan must be the cheapest antibiotic but a false economy which set back my recovery.
Fortunately, I have not yet had to experience being told I can have an appointment in two weeks’ time.  When one knows one needs attention, this is untenable.

I have to go in person to the centre if I need to speak to someone - that's quicker than trying by phone.

Whilst I can manage the online patchs system, I'm sure older patients have an absolute nightmare with it. That said, often patchs is unavailable and I think it should be possible to submit a request 24/7 and not have the system so frequently closed.

finally, I was upset at my recent smear test. Just after the test was completed as I was talking to the nurse by her desk, a male dr knocked on the door and came straight in without waiting for a response. Had he done that just a few minutes earlier, I would have been mid test. The nurse said she had locked the door, but this hadn't been done. I don't think it's acceptable that if a nurse or dr is with a patient that the appt is interrupted - the dr only wanted a blood pressure arm band and if that had happened during my test, I would have been furious and made a formal complaint.

However, your out of hours system is excellent, and being able to see the out of hours doctors over the weekend is fantastic. The option of smear test, blood test and more besides over the weekend is brilliant. And [PERSON] on Reception is lovely - so kind, helpful and efficient.

The issue is getting through on the phone, trying to secure a doctor appt in the first instance, and for older patients, having to navigate everything online.",Not at all easyNeither satisfied nor dissatisfiedNeither good nor poorFairly goodFairly poor,275,0.2368055555555555,0.5714120370370371,0.076,0.788,0.136,0.971,positive,,Weekend Service Availability

I was needed a repeat prescription for a medication I have been on for around 5 years. I was given a phone appointment which is ok however as I have never been to the practice nor ever been to a gp in the uk I was expecting to have an in person appointment. I was lucky to get a same day phone appointment. The problems started while on the phone to the gp, stated they don’t often prescribe the medication I am usually on, but could give be a months dose and gave me a list of alternative medications. My concern is that this medication is an antidepressants that I have been stable on for 5 years. From my understanding the practice and gps do not want to prescribe me the medication as it cost the practice more than alternatives which have not worked for me the past. The gp is putting their need/ wants ahead of the patient that they are meant to be caring for. If the practice refuses to continue to prescribe this medication for me I will have to look into a private go which as a nurse working in the nhs is not an sustainable option for me",Fairly easyFairly dissatisfiedVery poorVery poorFairly poor,217,0.1148148148148148,0.3537037037037037,0.016,0.932,0.052,0.8135,positive,,Telephone Service

Recent experiences of arranging appointments have improved, but generally the administration is still appalling. There are multiple access channels, some of which are no-reply, forcing me back to the phone. I use the NHS app, but it feels hit and miss whether I will be able to do things on the app, often I get messages to say ""your practice does not support x"". Appointment calendars only look 2 weeks ahead and get fully booked up, so I get told to ring back in a week - that is insane. I get sent appointments for things I never asked for (eg tests) at times I can't make, but no means of referring back, so the time just gets wasted. I get sent appointments for things I do want at times that suit you, but not me, so even more time is wasted. I know you are not stupid people, so I have to conclude that you (the partners) are not really focused on the needs of your patients, or if you are, then you are unwilling to confront the poor performance of your practice managers.",Not very easyFairly dissatisfiedFairly poorFairly poorVery poor,195,-6.167905692361981e-18,0.4208333333333333,0.141,0.793,0.067,-0.9555,negative,,Appointment Accessibility

One hand there doesn’t know what the other is doing. I was told to have our 3 year old come in for a routine vaccine check-up with the GP as we recently moved from the USA, but the vaccine nurse wasn’t available that day and had to come in a separate day later for the vaccines. Disorganized and the staff clearly doesn’t communicate with one another, nor do they have a lot of foresight regarding urging me to having a cervical smear while pregnant.

Unwelcoming receptionist dealt with me and was fairly unhelpful.    
Since then, emails have been lost, appointments made for an address in Chelsea Manor Street turned out to be in the main surgery, and to date I still have no idea who your Doctor's are or how many....... I had spoken on the phone to a Doctor but he apparently left when I tried to make contact with him.
It may be that you have too many patients and not enough time deal with them.

I have waited 20 minutes, and the recorded message told me there was ONE person in front of me in the queue.  The music is GHASTLY! I have been texted to phone for a pre-diabetic appt, and I keep putting it off cos I can't bear the waiting time and music.  Sometimes the receptionist is not good at English speaking. The other problem is: prescriptions.   There is a mandatory form which is too 'cut and dried'.  It does not allow you to ask for what you want, just a set format.  I have constantly told  them NOT to send mine by EPS and I will collect it from the surgery.  I want it to work at ANY CHEMIST and not the one on the top, as this restricts where I can go, and the chemist many not have the type of pills I want.  I have told them to take the bar code off the side, so it is REDEEMABLE AT ANY CHEMIST, and I have had much trouble getting this through to them.  They just send it by EPS, without READING WHAT I PUT ON THE FORM!   Could you please ask my opinion without a link on the phone?  I have NO SMARTPHONE, so can't click on the link, and to give my opinion, I have to type in 20 letters on the Net browser.  i can't be bothered to do this, so most of the surveys go unanswered.

I heve had an incredibly valuable experience whilst i have been under their care.  The Chelsea Practice has a very high standard of listening, supporting & robust response to the many complex ihealth issues i have needed to manage.  At times i have been in personal despair owing to severe mental health break downs, anxiety & depression die to housing conditions, debt management, duabetes, &  severe post-yraumatic stress.  Ovee the years the surgery has consitently been there when i've been in crisis.  The paractice always feels comunity oriented (eg; reception are attentive, keen & never make you feel like they are in a hurry.  The Nurses, Social Precribers ([PERSON] are truly practical & have provided me with opening pathways for me to manage my life in a more healthy & inclusive way.  I have a deep feeling of gratitude forall that Dr [PERSON], Dr [PERSON] & the entire team at The Chelsea Practice.  It can only be through dedication & hard work that such a service can be so consitent in their endevours.  I do think that if you wish to find a great example of how services  in todays NHS should be.  Then i truly dont think you could find a better example.

Dr [PERSON] was also amazing with my partner for his appointment. However, my appointment with Dr [PERSON] was not good and I don’t feel comfortable talking to her again, she started off our appointment with incorrect assumptions (that I was privately diagnosed with ADHD), but she had my diagnosis letter up on her screen with the NHS logo in the corner and it also explains in the first few lines that it is Right To Choose, she immediately went on to mention the “influx of private diagnoses” and the BBC panorama, whilst I understand her concerns, her approach was not a good one at all and showed heavy skepticism which immediately make me uncomfortable. I was caught off guard and did get a little emotional but not massively, whilst she did backtrack from this once I explained how ADHD affects my life (which is why I got emotional), how it is harmful for her as a clinician to take the approach she is taking especially largely quoting a very damaging sensationalist TV program, as opposed to reliable sources, and how frustrating it is to have waited for so long to be diagnosed to be told that I may not be able to get medication when it isn’t our fault as patients that the ADHD waiting lists are so long, I wouldn’t mind doing a regular NHS assessment but the issue is that we can’t access them, not that we (as patients) don’t want to and are choosing to “pay for a diagnosis” (which I didn’t anyhow). I do sympathise with her concerns and understand as a clinician she should raise any concerns she has, my problem is that she didn’t take an open minded curious approach, and on top of that when I later read her notes on my record I realised that she has gotten the details largely incorrect (facts she recorded about my life), as well as recording that I was “upset that she needed to discuss things between the team” which isn’t the case at all, I was only upset about the approach having being caught off guard, and frustrated by the ADHD system overall given how massively it impacts my life. A more kind, curious and sympathetic approach would have been appreciated, and I don’t feel that referring to the panorama is very appropriate as a source of information given the issues with the reporting. I feel uncomfortable asking to correct the notes because I don’t want to come across as difficult or pedantic, or for it to have a negative impact on my relationship with the practice or my future care. I have had largely positive interactions with the NHS but the negative ones, including a previous misdiagnosis where the clinician ignored my concerns, have had a damaging impact on my confidence in the healthcare system and made me rather reluctant to engage with it, I try not to be cynical but it feels hard to advocate for yourself as a patient and it’s also been very difficult to access treatment aside from Right to Choose, not in terms of referrals because I’ve not experienced any issues there at all, my past GP was great with this (I haven’t yet needed any at the Chelsea practice), but in terms of waiting lists it feels a little pointless to try",Very easyNeither satisfied nor dissatisfiedVery goodFairly goodFairly good,567,0.0296111626468769,0.5905569133247704,0.106,0.789,0.105,-0.6225,negative,,Doctor Consultations

I feel so sad & concerned - the demands &  pressures r too great and I just don’t know how they do their jobs, & put up with it in such circumstances !   
If I have any beef, it’s the inconsistency with girls on reception… they all wish to help but I think the inundation telephone calls must be just dreadful with all the demands placed upon them from (what I have actually witnessed in reception is:  unreasonable impatience, demands + such rudeness & hostility towards them at times that it is, UNBELIEVABLE). … naturally & understandable this can reflect back upon  the next patient, unless they are-able to deal with it in such a way as it , ‘Not being personal’; like ‘Water off a Ducks Back’, BUT HOW DO THEY not TAKE THAT HOME!? And further,  day-in & day-out must be pretty challenging, Believe you are on top of it and able to deal with it…. 
IMPORTANT - Your Practice  warning signs aren’t sufficient because the BEHAVE SIGNAGE   needs to be DESCRIBED BETTER such as ,in my opinion, DISPLAY A LIST OF THE UNACCEPTABLE,    ’TRUTH/TRUE
 THINGS as in THE wholly unreasonable  things patients have demanded or said to staff - U can, ‘CALL IT OUT’ via example rather than the obligatory dolled out “We will not tolerate”, of whatever the wording!!
NOW, THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS… I would not be here now had it not been for the outstanding GP, Dr Sapuay.  AND, All the GPs please no, especially currently for one Gyne (&breast unexpectedly) area , Dr Hayes have been OUTSTANDING since we were transferred to you from our wonderful GP’s Dr Rowley & BOREHAM IN THURLOE PLACE STH KENSINGTON !

It is a little confusing knowing which surgery to enter to acknowledge your arrival for appointment. I have been sent backwards and forwards with reception staff not knowing location of GP.
