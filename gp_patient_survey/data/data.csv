2024-02-22 15:55:41,Earls Court Surgery,Fairly easy,Very dissatisfied,Very poor,Very poor,Very poor,"It’s very frustrating the process of booking any appointments, the waiting time to see a doctor is for a phone call with the doctors 1week while for a in person appointment is 2 weeks. Receptionists take liberty to decide if you are urgent or not and booking the appointments accordingly saying the doctors are busy, then when you go in person there isn’t anyone in the clinic and doctors are free. The doctors take everything lightly and they don’t even check your symptoms, refuse to make referrals to the NHS and suggest to go privately. Sometimes i wait 2-3months before seeing my GP as I know the answer will always be “you have nothing so don’t worry” by only looking my face.

The speed with which Dr [PERSON] effected my transfer made it posdible for me be urgently seen very quickly by a top cancer consultant and rapidly undergo  blood tests,MRI and PET, scans quickly followed up with intense chemotherapy, which enabled me to then go onto chemoradiotherapy and I am now on immunology trials.

Follow-up with repeat prescriptions &c are also excellent.  There have been a few occasions in the past when individuals on the reception desk have seemed brusque or impatient though I can't imagine this was intentional, and more recently they have been much more welcoming and helpful.  Perhaps an NHS-wide issue is inter-site/department communication between specialist hospital provision and surgery monitoring, resulting in duplication of procedures such as blood pressure and other function tests.  For example, I have a wide spectrum of tests at Chelsea & Westminster twice a year as part of my ongoing HIV management, but I suspect these are not passed to you (despite my permission to do so). If they were they could save surgery time collecting the data again .

Most days if you don’t wait 50 minutes to get through at 8am you get told there’s no Drs on due to illness usually. Only being able to call at 8am is unfair. I have a very stressful and busy job and 8am is when I need to commute. I either lose my job or suffer health problems as you dare not ring at any other time or reception will snap at you and tell you the next non emergency appointment is in 2026. If you do get an appointment it’s on the phone, then the Dr gets you to come in anyway… It’s double the time spent on an issue cos the reception staff on the phone flat out refuse to let you bypass the pointless phone calls. Huge changes are needed at this surgery, it’s an utter disgrace! The Drs are very good if you ever get to see one. The reception staff are extremely obstructive and devoid of common sense. They live and die by what the computer tells them. I understand that the Tories have defunded the NHS massively, but the reception staff could at least try a little to help more. I’m sick to the teeth of paying an outrageous amount in tax that pays your staffs wages to be treated like crap and never get a Drs appointment. I have gone private multiple times over the last few years cos of how bad this survey is. Shame on you all.

I had a horrible experience few years ago with a nurse who tried to introduce a coil and she nearly tortured me to make also very humiliating comments . The coil was easily introduce by a private gynaecologist. I referred the matter to doctor hussein . I dismissed me without [PERSON] answering . I went to the practise again recently after a very painful renal colic and a recurrent issue with my shoulder . The GP who visited me was kind but superficial . After the colic I should be referred to stone clinic ( as I have still one ) and I should repeat the blood test . There was also an anomaly in the other kidney . She dismissed me with nothing . She just suggested to self refer to physio clinic for my shoulder but I am doing things privately. Only way to survive .

I have been monitored regularly for blood pressure and cholesterol changes and have been efficiently issued with the appropriate prescriptions and vaccinations. Had my GP not seen the slight rise in my PSA levels, I would not have had the opportunity to receive excellent prostrate cancer treatment and after-care from Royal Marsden in their Rapid Diagnostic Centre. Happily, over the last two years I have had very positive outcomes from the mandatory blood tests and now on 6-monthly checks instead of three monthly. At 78, I remain in full time professional practice and have not had to take a single day off on account of my health.

(1) It's been a pain trying to schedule vaccinations for my baby daughter - if we try to arrange ahead of time, when prompted by the SMS messages received, then reception staff tell us that the rota isn't yet available and that they'll call us back once it is, but then they don't call back and when we then call to arrange a time, we find that the times are impossible ones (and that sometimes you can spend almost an hour on hold as the second in the queue). 
(2) I was asked to come in for a blood pressure test, but wasn't seen for an hour despite speaking to reception staff several times, only to finally be told I could use the machine at the back of the reception (which was news to me!). I still then got a call a few hours later telling me I hadn't shown up!

If I were holding a fevered baby and had a crying two year old clinging to my legs, I would be angry at being told to treat you with courtesy and to use your website.  In a worried state, I wouldn’t be an able to navigate your website or any other!
My only appointment  in a long time was in January this year for bronchitis.   I was seen by a doctor I had never heard of who prescribed Amoxicillin.  After seven days on this, I was in a worse state and several friends told me it always was  a useless antibiotic.   A private doctor then put me on Zithromax for five days which finally had an effect.  I conclude that Amoxicillan must be the cheapest antibiotic but a false economy which set back my recovery.
Fortunately, I have not yet had to experience being told I can have an appointment in two weeks’ time.  When one knows one needs attention, this is untenable.

I have to go in person to the centre if I need to speak to someone - that's quicker than trying by phone.

Whilst I can manage the online patchs system, I'm sure older patients have an absolute nightmare with it. That said, often patchs is unavailable and I think it should be possible to submit a request 24/7 and not have the system so frequently closed.

finally, I was upset at my recent smear test. Just after the test was completed as I was talking to the nurse by her desk, a male dr knocked on the door and came straight in without waiting for a response. Had he done that just a few minutes earlier, I would have been mid test. The nurse said she had locked the door, but this hadn't been done. I don't think it's acceptable that if a nurse or dr is with a patient that the appt is interrupted - the dr only wanted a blood pressure arm band and if that had happened during my test, I would have been furious and made a formal complaint.

However, your out of hours system is excellent, and being able to see the out of hours doctors over the weekend is fantastic. The option of smear test, blood test and more besides over the weekend is brilliant. And [PERSON] on Reception is lovely - so kind, helpful and efficient.

The issue is getting through on the phone, trying to secure a doctor appt in the first instance, and for older patients, having to navigate everything online.",Not at all easyNeither satisfied nor dissatisfiedNeither good nor poorFairly goodFairly poor,275,0.2368055555555555,0.5714120370370371,0.076,0.788,0.136,0.971,positive,,Weekend Service Availability

I was needed a repeat prescription for a medication I have been on for around 5 years. I was given a phone appointment which is ok however as I have never been to the practice nor ever been to a gp in the uk I was expecting to have an in person appointment. I was lucky to get a same day phone appointment. The problems started while on the phone to the gp, stated they don’t often prescribe the medication I am usually on, but could give be a months dose and gave me a list of alternative medications. My concern is that this medication is an antidepressants that I have been stable on for 5 years. From my understanding the practice and gps do not want to prescribe me the medication as it cost the practice more than alternatives which have not worked for me the past. The gp is putting their need/ wants ahead of the patient that they are meant to be caring for. If the practice refuses to continue to prescribe this medication for me I will have to look into a private go which as a nurse working in the nhs is not an sustainable option for me",Fairly easyFairly dissatisfiedVery poorVery poorFairly poor,217,0.1148148148148148,0.3537037037037037,0.016,0.932,0.052,0.8135,positive,,Telephone Service

Recent experiences of arranging appointments have improved, but generally the administration is still appalling. There are multiple access channels, some of which are no-reply, forcing me back to the phone. I use the NHS app, but it feels hit and miss whether I will be able to do things on the app, often I get messages to say ""your practice does not support x"". Appointment calendars only look 2 weeks ahead and get fully booked up, so I get told to ring back in a week - that is insane. I get sent appointments for things I never asked for (eg tests) at times I can't make, but no means of referring back, so the time just gets wasted. I get sent appointments for things I do want at times that suit you, but not me, so even more time is wasted. I know you are not stupid people, so I have to conclude that you (the partners) are not really focused on the needs of your patients, or if you are, then you are unwilling to confront the poor performance of your practice managers.",Not very easyFairly dissatisfiedFairly poorFairly poorVery poor,195,-6.167905692361981e-18,0.4208333333333333,0.141,0.793,0.067,-0.9555,negative,,Appointment Accessibility

One hand there doesn’t know what the other is doing. I was told to have our 3 year old come in for a routine vaccine check-up with the GP as we recently moved from the USA, but the vaccine nurse wasn’t available that day and had to come in a separate day later for the vaccines. Disorganized and the staff clearly doesn’t communicate with one another, nor do they have a lot of foresight regarding urging me to having a cervical smear while pregnant.

Unwelcoming receptionist dealt with me and was fairly unhelpful.    
Since then, emails have been lost, appointments made for an address in Chelsea Manor Street turned out to be in the main surgery, and to date I still have no idea who your Doctor's are or how many....... I had spoken on the phone to a Doctor but he apparently left when I tried to make contact with him.
It may be that you have too many patients and not enough time deal with them.

I have waited 20 minutes, and the recorded message told me there was ONE person in front of me in the queue.  The music is GHASTLY! I have been texted to phone for a pre-diabetic appt, and I keep putting it off cos I can't bear the waiting time and music.  Sometimes the receptionist is not good at English speaking. The other problem is: prescriptions.   There is a mandatory form which is too 'cut and dried'.  It does not allow you to ask for what you want, just a set format.  I have constantly told  them NOT to send mine by EPS and I will collect it from the surgery.  I want it to work at ANY CHEMIST and not the one on the top, as this restricts where I can go, and the chemist many not have the type of pills I want.  I have told them to take the bar code off the side, so it is REDEEMABLE AT ANY CHEMIST, and I have had much trouble getting this through to them.  They just send it by EPS, without READING WHAT I PUT ON THE FORM!   Could you please ask my opinion without a link on the phone?  I have NO SMARTPHONE, so can't click on the link, and to give my opinion, I have to type in 20 letters on the Net browser.  i can't be bothered to do this, so most of the surveys go unanswered.

I heve had an incredibly valuable experience whilst i have been under their care.  The Chelsea Practice has a very high standard of listening, supporting & robust response to the many complex ihealth issues i have needed to manage.  At times i have been in personal despair owing to severe mental health break downs, anxiety & depression die to housing conditions, debt management, duabetes, &  severe post-yraumatic stress.  Ovee the years the surgery has consitently been there when i've been in crisis.  The paractice always feels comunity oriented (eg; reception are attentive, keen & never make you feel like they are in a hurry.  The Nurses, Social Precribers ([PERSON] are truly practical & have provided me with opening pathways for me to manage my life in a more healthy & inclusive way.  I have a deep feeling of gratitude forall that Dr [PERSON], Dr [PERSON] & the entire team at The Chelsea Practice.  It can only be through dedication & hard work that such a service can be so consitent in their endevours.  I do think that if you wish to find a great example of how services  in todays NHS should be.  Then i truly dont think you could find a better example.

Dr [PERSON] was also amazing with my partner for his appointment. However, my appointment with Dr [PERSON] was not good and I don’t feel comfortable talking to her again, she started off our appointment with incorrect assumptions (that I was privately diagnosed with ADHD), but she had my diagnosis letter up on her screen with the NHS logo in the corner and it also explains in the first few lines that it is Right To Choose, she immediately went on to mention the “influx of private diagnoses” and the BBC panorama, whilst I understand her concerns, her approach was not a good one at all and showed heavy skepticism which immediately make me uncomfortable. I was caught off guard and did get a little emotional but not massively, whilst she did backtrack from this once I explained how ADHD affects my life (which is why I got emotional), how it is harmful for her as a clinician to take the approach she is taking especially largely quoting a very damaging sensationalist TV program, as opposed to reliable sources, and how frustrating it is to have waited for so long to be diagnosed to be told that I may not be able to get medication when it isn’t our fault as patients that the ADHD waiting lists are so long, I wouldn’t mind doing a regular NHS assessment but the issue is that we can’t access them, not that we (as patients) don’t want to and are choosing to “pay for a diagnosis” (which I didn’t anyhow). I do sympathise with her concerns and understand as a clinician she should raise any concerns she has, my problem is that she didn’t take an open minded curious approach, and on top of that when I later read her notes on my record I realised that she has gotten the details largely incorrect (facts she recorded about my life), as well as recording that I was “upset that she needed to discuss things between the team” which isn’t the case at all, I was only upset about the approach having being caught off guard, and frustrated by the ADHD system overall given how massively it impacts my life. A more kind, curious and sympathetic approach would have been appreciated, and I don’t feel that referring to the panorama is very appropriate as a source of information given the issues with the reporting. I feel uncomfortable asking to correct the notes because I don’t want to come across as difficult or pedantic, or for it to have a negative impact on my relationship with the practice or my future care. I have had largely positive interactions with the NHS but the negative ones, including a previous misdiagnosis where the clinician ignored my concerns, have had a damaging impact on my confidence in the healthcare system and made me rather reluctant to engage with it, I try not to be cynical but it feels hard to advocate for yourself as a patient and it’s also been very difficult to access treatment aside from Right to Choose, not in terms of referrals because I’ve not experienced any issues there at all, my past GP was great with this (I haven’t yet needed any at the Chelsea practice), but in terms of waiting lists it feels a little pointless to try",Very easyNeither satisfied nor dissatisfiedVery goodFairly goodFairly good,567,0.0296111626468769,0.5905569133247704,0.106,0.789,0.105,-0.6225,negative,,Doctor Consultations

I feel so sad & concerned - the demands &  pressures r too great and I just don’t know how they do their jobs, & put up with it in such circumstances !   
If I have any beef, it’s the inconsistency with girls on reception… they all wish to help but I think the inundation telephone calls must be just dreadful with all the demands placed upon them from (what I have actually witnessed in reception is:  unreasonable impatience, demands + such rudeness & hostility towards them at times that it is, UNBELIEVABLE). … naturally & understandable this can reflect back upon  the next patient, unless they are-able to deal with it in such a way as it , ‘Not being personal’; like ‘Water off a Ducks Back’, BUT HOW DO THEY not TAKE THAT HOME!? And further,  day-in & day-out must be pretty challenging, Believe you are on top of it and able to deal with it…. 
IMPORTANT - Your Practice  warning signs aren’t sufficient because the BEHAVE SIGNAGE   needs to be DESCRIBED BETTER such as ,in my opinion, DISPLAY A LIST OF THE UNACCEPTABLE,    ’TRUTH/TRUE
 THINGS as in THE wholly unreasonable  things patients have demanded or said to staff - U can, ‘CALL IT OUT’ via example rather than the obligatory dolled out “We will not tolerate”, of whatever the wording!!
NOW, THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS… I would not be here now had it not been for the outstanding GP, Dr Sapuay.

1) Constant change of doctors - no permanent medical team.  No doctor there long enough to know the patients.
2) Referred for ECO in Feb 2022 after always being breathless. Seven months later I discovered results came back saying I needed constant BP monitoring, but I never heard from the practice in this regard and until I spoke to Dr [PERSON] about my own BP reading of 200 over 107 that September, I had no idea that I had a real problem!  Since then several further tests carried out, having been taken into C&W by ambulance with fibrillation and tachycardia, but am left not knowing where I go from here and have been given no advice, or guidance regarding diet or exercise to help with my condition.

I use the PATCHS system and get a speedy response.  PATCHS is an easy digital system.  The digital communication between my Sjogren's Syndrome consultant at Charing Cross and the doctors at my surgery is excellent.  When my consultant recently sent a letter with a suggestion to the GPs, a GP contacted me the next day via PATCHS with this suggestion for further treatment if I wanted it.  The PATCHS system is used very well by me and the surgery's admin team to very quickly provide me with repeat prescriptions, send messages to a GP or the admin team, make an appointment, etc.  But, of course, there are so many patients and so few doctors to cover such a large practice that getting a speedy face-to-face appointment is impossible- unless the info a patient enters into PATCHS suggests that the symptoms indicate an emergency situation.  But fortunately and knock on wood, at 80, soon to be 81, I very rarely have any need to request an appointment. So I don't know if the waiting times for an appointment have improved since I had my last appointment for any illness well over a year ago.

2024-03-02 16:25:13,Health Partners at Violet Melchett,Not very easy,Fairly satisfied,Fairly poor,Fairly good,Fairly good,"I joined the Redcliffe Surgery in 1965. That is nearly 60 years ago. The current ethos has lost the human ethos of yesteryear, partly for reasons that cannot be overcome in the present situation of massive underfunding of the NHS, the stupidity of Brexit, ever more pressure from ever more patients, and much else. I know it is harder and harder.. BUT, if you want to improve, there is room for improvement. 
[1] My wife is almost 102 years of age. I think anyone 80 yrs and more, the genuine  elderlies, need much more careful watching, and monitoring, especially in regards to the need for follow-up. Things that a specialist might ask the surgery to do are not done, as if the message never got through. 
The follow-up in the surgery needs improving more generally.
[2] It is often necessary to follow up with one's GP, and getting through to them can feel like  too many hoops to jump. If I have a blood test and get a very technical feedback, I won't understand it. The GP out to explain a complicated list of outcomes automatically. 
[3] I have been seen over months by the Tissue Viability department at St Charles. When no longer seen by them, they claimed a letter to my surgery detailing my 'after care' was sent. But when I raised this with my GP, there was general non compression about what TV expected the surgery to do! I was left hanging in the air, and when an emergency arose, neither GP nor supposedly specialist nurse knew what to do. 
[4] Mostly those answering the phone do a good job -- especially the person who has been there the longest -- though occasionally messages get confused, or are somehow lost in translation, so to speak.
[5] Empathy can be taught. The human element aids healing. I once was with a GP who, as I tried to explain some anxiety regarding my health, was looking at their watch. Givimng the impression, as sub-text, 'please go as fast as you can' is not good. It is anti-healing, the most basic and worst mistake. 
[6] I think patients such as myself should be invited in to give feedback, and make constructive criticism, on a regular basis. Maybe a group of such people should meet occasionally with doctors.

cante wasteya,
Dr [PERSON]

I work in a school, so it makes sense to get an appointment in the school holidays, yet, this is impossible as you can’t book in advance - not sure why.  You gave to call on the day and wait in a long queue.  We don’t have a fixed doctor, so you see anybody who happens to be around. I was booked in for a blood test and the nurse who saw me was sweeping the floor as I entered the room and then stated she was not able to take blood!  I came away feeling that perhaps she was the cleaning lady and there was a mix up.   My daughter has also had a terrible experience at your clinic.  
It is hardly surprising that the A&E are bursting over, as from my experience taking my daughter there, not many people waiting looked an emergency.  I feel due to the way doctors surgeries are run.

Main issues are:
1. Inefficient reception staff. Any time I phone there can be at least a 10 minute wait for an answer. There were 4 at a recent visit but only one was dealing with patients, the others were staring at screens. Later, there were SIX staff, all looking confused.
On my last visit I heard a patient being told by the little Asian female receptionist that Chelsea & Westminster Hospital was on Kings Rd - I had to tell him the correct location.  
2. A plastic screen stands between staff and patients meaning neither side can hear properly without shouting, often private details. The screen has been dirty though it had been cleaned when I went yesterday, maybe due to my comment to the Practice Manager. It should be removed, just causes frustration.
3. There’s not a feeling of respect by many staff, just that you’re an inconvenience. 
4. It’s very hard to see a doctor face-to-face. Phone appointments are inconvenient as there is no set time given in the day, so very hard particularly if you’re working.",Not very easyFairly dissatisfiedFairly poorNeither good nor poorFairly good,207,-0.0239772727272727,0.4676515151515151,0.149,0.82,0.03,-0.9749,negative,,Reception Staff Interaction

2024-03-06 11:20:04,The Abingdon Medical Practice,Not very easy,Very dissatisfied,Fairly poor,Very poor,Fairly poor,"Getting an in person appointment is a rarity. As a family we are in relative good health so we only go to the doctors when something really doesn’t feel right. Follow up is non existent unless initiated by oneself. The doctor never follows up. Test results are not related and unless something is out of the expected range, there is no follow up to tell you about it or if the symptoms continue to discuss alternative routes of action. When readings are slightly out of range, doesnt appear to know how to interpret them and relies on the labs notes…
If a specialist appointment is suggested, ALWAYS pushed down the private route (despite the fact we no longer have private insurance) and greatly discouraged of following the nhs route (‘don’t you read the press? Delays are inormous in hospital referrals). But that is perhaps our personal experience in particular with Dr [PERSON].
My daughter was also diagnosed with faecal impaction at A&E in C&W. We followed the protocol suggested and at that time there was a young doctor who helped tremendously. She DID do follow ups. In fact she scheduled them and would call in to check on progress. Sadly, the young lady left the practice very soon. Before leaving, she called us to let us know that she was leaving and to reassure us that she had discussed our case in details with the colleague that would be taking over. No one from the practice ever called after this lady left. What is chronic constipation that doesn’t clear over a couple of months despite obscene doses of movicol in a child, coupled with considerable weight loss? Clearly an irrelevance to this practice, or at least that is what you felt like.
Telephone appointments never run on time, which is to be expected, but if you miss the call after two rings, forget the doctor calling you back… you have to start a lengthy and convoluted chasing exercise.
You feel a mere number and an inconvenience at this surgery. Certainly not a good patient experience. The doctors appear not to care at all.",Not very easyVery dissatisfiedFairly poorVery poorFairly poor,353,0.0371164021164021,0.4047089947089947,0.067,0.849,0.083,0.8492,positive,,Test Results

Messages received from a doc by phone are read only, impossible to reply.

When booking an appointment online many doctors in the surgery are simply not listed , this does not make any sense.

There should be an online system where you can tick a box saying you are available for cancellations (my dentist operates like this).

At my last look, it is only possible to book telephone appointments online, but as its impossible to get through on the phone (it rings and rings and then goes to a very long recorded message and then hangs up - not possible to leave a voice message), its therefore impossible to book face to face appointments.  Reception staff have said to me a number of times that the system is down. I believe they, too, are frustrated.

Thank you.

I have had many investigations and was finally diagnosed with Fibromyalgia after a long time. Until diagnosis I had to be in contact with my practice for many tests and titrations of pain medication. They are so busy but professional and responsive to my needs. They do the right thing at the right time. Dr [PERSON] sometimes even mans the phones himself to help his reception team and to deal with queries immediately. He does this, he said to know what it’s like on the shop floor. I have felt frustrated at times and have been grumpy and unreasonable, even then, they have been kind and compassionate. Many GPs have no time, but I never feel rushed at The Good Practice, they are just good. Special thanks to Dr [PERSON] too for her time, patience and care. I always receive sterling service, here. Huge thanks to the whole team team too, they make the patient  experience feel safe and comfortable every time.

The GP I spoke to recently was very nice and helpful as is the nurse I’ve seen at the practice but reception staff have often given me the wrong information (leading to a serious issue with medication) or been very cold in manner which is off putting when trying to access help and support. Whilst I appreciate that having online services makes things easier for the practice I feel that it is illogical to expect people to feel safe operating in this way when it comes to their health. For me personally having a little more human contact and reassurance would go a long way to helping me manage my condition the best way I can. ,Fairly easyNeither satisfied nor dissatisfiedFairly poorFairly goodVery poor,158,0.0131249999999999,0.5366666666666668,0.058,0.715,0.226,0.9861,positive,,Reception Staff Interaction

I'd love to have been able to have spoken to a doctor on the same day with my 90 year old father in a practice in Herts so I do think that is good. A ring back system on the phone line so that one does not have to wait to get through for an unknown period of time is needed. You should be able to ring back numbers that elect for a call back. It's really difficult if you are working and impossible for mothers with young children often to stay on the phone for that period of time - often the children cut off the calls! I am also uneasy how rarely one does get to see a Dr in person and I fear  things don't necessarily get picked up - the kind of things one mentions on the way out but which turn out to be important. Just by looking at someone a good GP can tell a lot. I also think it's not great if a patient has an issue such as depression but which they haven't identified themselves. The times I have been very depressed have both been identified by two doctors outside the practice and they were right. I appreciate resources are very stretched and I do think this is a good practice generally, especially when compared with others.

2024-03-07 10:29:02,The Good Practice,Very easy,Very satisfied,Very good,Very good,Very good,"The Good Practice is the best surgery ever. The staff are all friendly, professional and very knowledgeable. Their system of how to make an appointment with a Doctor either over the phone or in person is so simple. When you call you know where you are in the queue and the option for a call back if it’s a long queue is wonderful. Although, when I call during the day I am usually caller number one. I can always rest assured I will be seen soon. They also have regular PPG meetings and have weekly classes to attend like yoga, choir and walks. This just shows how committed they are to their community of patients and our well being. The Good Practice should be a case study for “good practices” and emulated at all the other GP surgeries.
